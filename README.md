# Prechyk
Hari Om!

Everyone knows they aren't perfect but they can try to reach as close to perfectness as possible.

We all love Social Media , cant live without Netflix , Hulu etc . Even If we tried we cant escape the vast digitalisation of the world.
# So What Can We Do?
Thats why a organisation named Chinmaya Mission has took this task up of guiding any age groups to better themselves

*Children are lamps to be lit , not vessels to be filled - Pujya Gurudev Swami Chinmayananda*

Essentially we use texts,videos,photos and any other form of communication available to us to convey to ourselves how to essentially become a better human being

This is a self formed and self maintained group meetings that are weekly and discuss on a particular topic
Here we try to peel off the skin on the hair to better understand topics
As this is a group activity , one also understands and learns from others difficulties/experiences
